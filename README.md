### Motivation for studying AI
<p>
I am an undergraduate who dreams of contributing to the open-source community.

During my time at the NANUS startup, I developed an interest in AI including NLP.

However, I encounterd numerous challenges in developing an application from scratch, even a demo version.

This experience led me to wish for guidance from an assistant.

### Research Interests

I'm interested in multimodal downstream tasks towards AGI which is more human-like than AI.

Nowadays, I'm developing interests especially in 1) Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, 2) Video Question Answering, 3) Visual Programming.

Ultimately, I wish the marginalized continues to learn what they want via multimodal LLM without any difficulties.

I aim to combine personalized learning with cooperative study in the future.
